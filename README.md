# Intelligent Systems Project: Neural Networks

The task given was to create our own task based on one of several provided datasets, and solve it in the best way using neural networks.

We implemented a fuzzy model in Matlab and a neural network in Python. To create the optimal model, recurring neural networks, long short-term memory and gated recurring units were also explored.

Project grade was best in class with a 20/20 score.
